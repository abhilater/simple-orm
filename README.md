# simple-orm

A simple ORM (Object relational mapping) library to query SQL data-stores using the ORM paradigm.
This library is based on a project called **Phorm (Phoenix ORM)** which is written based on the same ideas used
in this project to provide a simple ORM based data access layer on top of Apache Phoenix + HBase data-store in Helpshift.
The goal was to build a simple but effective big data query platform on HBase using Phoenix and SQL for running low latency 
aggregated queries with support for filters and pagination to use in Helpshift's Analytics APIs.
